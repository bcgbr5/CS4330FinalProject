##C# History

C# was first released in [2002](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-WITHDRAWN/ECMA-334,%202nd%20edition,%20December%202002.pdf) as an effort to create ["to create a first class modern language on this platform that would appeal to the curly braces crowd: the C++ programmers of the world at the time, and competitively, the Java programmers."](http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/261958/-z_programming_languages_c). It was developed under the original name of Cool (C like Object Oriented Language), as an object oriented language under the .net platform.  Other sources have refered to it, sometimes derisivly as a clone of [Java](https://www.cnet.com/news/why-microsofts-c-isnt/). Although, Java has somtimes taken features from C# releases and integrated them into itself, such as [enums and boxing/unboxing](http://www.barrycornelius.com/papers/java5/onefile/#body.1_div1.1).  With the developmet of Mono and Microsofts own push with Xamarin, there has been a slow push away from Microsofts native platforms.
