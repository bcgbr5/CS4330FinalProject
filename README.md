# CS4330 Final Project

Brandon Greer

Comparison of the C# and Swift languages from an object oriented perspective


All swift Code examples are provided as both Swift playground files for use in Xcode and .swift files which can be copy pasted into [IBM's Bluemix](https://swift.sandbox.bluemix.net/#/repl).  I will try to provide links to most of the examples as shared files on bluemix in the .swift files as well.
